# Go Board Game

This is a two-player online Go board game that allows players to play against each other via the internet.

## Description

The project consists of a client-side HTML interface and a server-side Python backend using Flask and Flask-SocketIO for real-time communication.

Players can place stones on the Go board by clicking on the intersections. The game enforces basic rules such as territory control, stone capture, and scoring.
